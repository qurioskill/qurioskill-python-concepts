# More Python Data Types

So far, we've looked at some of the **core built-in data types** in
Python: 

- Numbers (`int`, `float`, `complex`) 
- Strings (`str`) 
- Lists (`list`) 
- Tuples (`tuple`) 
- Sets (`set`)
- Dictionaries (`dict`)
- Booleans (`bool`)

But Python has **many more data types and data structures** that you can
use depending on your needs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Other Built-in Data Types**

Here are some additional built-in data types you may encounter:

-   **Bytes & Bytearray** → Used for handling binary data.
-   **Range** → Represents a sequence of numbers, often used in loops.
-   **NoneType** → Special type with only one value: `None`.
-   **Frozen Set** → An immutable version of a set.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Beyond Built-ins**

Python also has powerful **modules** that provide advanced data
structures: - **`collections` module** → `Counter`, `defaultdict`,
`OrderedDict`, `deque`, `namedtuple`. - **`array` module** → Efficient
storage of basic numeric types. - **`decimal` and `fractions` modules**
→ For precise decimal arithmetic and rational numbers.

## **Exploring More**

If you'd like to explore all the data types Python provides, here are
some excellent resources:

## **Summary**

-   Python has many built-in data types, but also specialized types for
    advanced use cases.
-   You don't need to memorize all of them right away. Focus first on
    the common ones: numbers, strings, lists, sets, tuples, and
    dictionaries.
-   Explore official docs and tutorials as you grow more comfortable
    with Python.

Understanding Python's data types is the first step toward mastering the
language!
