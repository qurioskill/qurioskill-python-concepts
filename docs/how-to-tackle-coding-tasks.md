# A Simple Four‑Step Approach to Solving Programming Tasks

When you face a new coding challenge, use these four practical steps to stay organized and make steady progress.

## 1. Map Your Inputs

- **What will the program receive?**  
  *Examples: a list of numbers, a user‑typed string, a CSV file, API JSON.*
- **What edge cases exist?**  
  *Empty list vs. long list, invalid text, missing fields.*

Write down each input type and edge case so nothing surprises you later.

## 2. Define the Desired Output

- **What should the program produce?**  
  *A single number? A formatted report? A modified file?*
- **In what format?**  
  *Plain text, JSON, CSV, printed lines, a return value?*

Clarity here makes planning the middle steps much easier.

## 3. Sketch the Data Transformations

Plan the route from input to output:

- **Operations** – addition, string slicing, sorting, etc.  
- **Control flow** – `if` checks, loops, list comprehensions.  
- **Helper functions** – small reusable chunks to keep code tidy.

A quick bullet list or flowchart is usually enough. You just need direction, not perfection.

## 4. Build Iteratively

1. **Start small** – implement the simplest path from input to correct output.  
2. **Run and test** – confirm that basic case works.  
3. **Add features or edge cases one at a time** – test after each change.  
4. **Refactor as you go** – keep the code readable.

Small steps keep bugs local and progress visible.

### Quick Reference

| Step | Question to Ask  | What to Produce               |
|------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1    | “What comes in?” | List inputs & edge cases      |
| 2    | “What should come out?” | Clear output example/format |
| 3    | “How does data change?” | Bullet‑point plan of operations |
| 4    | “How do we get there?” | Working code, refined iteratively |

Stick to these four steps and you’ll turn vague tasks into reliable, maintainable programs—without the overwhelm.
